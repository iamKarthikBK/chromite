Trap Handling
=============

Traps within the Chromite core can be either synchronous traps or interrupts. The synchronous traps
are generated by exception causing instructions through various stages of the pipeline. Examples -
Instruction Access Fault, Page Faults, Mis-aligned Faults, Illegal Instructions.

The Chromite core supports three basic classes of interrupts: timer interrupts, software interrupts
and external interrupts. The timer interrupt is generated through an on-chip timer module. The
software interrupt is generated by setting specific bits within the Core-Level-Interrupt (CLINT) module. 
The external interrupts are generated by a Platform Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC) after 
capture of external events. 

Each of the above class of interrupts can be generated in any of the operation modes - Machine,
Supervisor or User. Chromite cores also provide the ability to delegate handling of some of the
traps/interrupts to a lower operation mode using standard delegation CSRs. 

The core also supports vectored mode of interrupts, where the trap-vector is generated based on the
cause of the trap, allowing fast access to interrupt routines.
