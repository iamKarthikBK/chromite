Modes of Operation
==================

The Chromite core supports 4 standard modes of operations:

* Debug: This is highest level of operation which provides access to all
  features of the core and the system. Typically, this mode is used for software development and
  bring-up phases. This mode is available only if the debugging option is
  enabled at design time.

* Machine: This is the highest mode of software execution and is mandatory in all variants
  generated by the Chromite core. The code running in machine mode is inherently trusted and has
  access to all implementation resources. 

* Supervisor: This is an optional mode between the machine and user modes, typically used for
  providing isolation between a supervisor-level operating system and the user execution
  environment.

* User: This is lowest mode of operation where user applications are executed.

**Note**: Future versions of the core will also include a hypervisor mode, between the machine and 
supervisor to enable supervisor/OS virtualisation and stronger security semantics.
